# py-workflow-system — Agent Guide

## Project overview

`py-workflow-system` is a **vibe coding lesson starter project**. Users clone this repo and use it as a foundation to build their own workflow system. It's intentionally minimal — the scaffold provides the wiring (Docker Compose, service structure, database config) so learners can jump straight into building features without spending a session on boilerplate.

## 🔒 Immutable files

Do NOT modify these files under any circumstances. They define the fundamental infrastructure contract:

| File                         | Reason                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.env` (root)                | User port configuration — set once at machine setup. **Never change `FRONTEND_PORT`, `BACKEND_PORT`, or `VITE_BACKEND_URL`.** |
| `devops/docker-compose.yml`  | Production Docker Compose — SQLite volume mount.                                                                              |
| `devops/backend/Dockerfile`  | Production backend Docker image.                                                                                              |
| `devops/frontend/Dockerfile` | Production frontend Docker image.                                                                                             |

If you believe a change to these files is necessary, explain the problem to the user and ask them to make the edit manually.

## Tech stack

| Layer    | Technology                                |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Backend  | Python (FastAPI) — SQLAlchemy with SQLite |
| Frontend | React with TypeScript (Vite)              |
| Database | SQLite                                    |
| Infra    | Docker Compose (production only)          |

---

## Architecture

The system runs with **SQLite** (zero-config) and **frontend/backend locally on the host**:

```
┌──────────┐  /api + /auth  ┌──────────────┐
│  Browser │ ──(Vite proxy)─►│   Backend     │
│  :5173   │ ◄────────────── │   :8080       │
└──────────┘      HTTP      │  (SQLite DB)  │
                            └──────────────┘
```

> Ports shown are defaults. Configurable once per machine via `FRONTEND_PORT`, `BACKEND_PORT` in root `.env`.
>
> **🚫 Port conflict rule — READ THIS BEFORE TOUCHING ANY PORT:**
>
> - **NEVER edit `.env` to resolve a port conflict.** The `.env` file is immutable once created.
> - **NEVER use a different port (e.g. port+1) when the configured port is busy.** This includes Vite's auto-port-increment behaviour — do NOT accept it.
> - If a port is occupied, the **only** correct action is:
>   1. Run `scripts/stop-all.sh` (or `scripts\stop-all.bat` on Windows) to kill whatever is using the port.
>   2. Then restart with `scripts/start-all.sh` (or `scripts\start-all.bat`).
> - Do **not** pass a different port via CLI flags, environment overrides, `--port`, `--strictPort`, or any other mechanism that bypasses `.env`.
> - The only permitted reason to change `.env` ports is during the very first machine setup when the defaults permanently clash with other installed software — and only the **user** should make that edit, not the agent.

### Services

1. **database** — SQLite. File stored at `backend/db/pyworkflow.db`, auto-created on startup. No server needed.

2. **backend** — Python FastAPI server running locally. Uses `uv` for dependency management (`pyproject.toml`). Reads config from `backend/.env`. Default port 8080 (configurable via `BACKEND_PORT`).

3. **frontend** — React + TypeScript app with Vite, running locally. Reads `VITE_BACKEND_URL` from root `.env` via `loadEnv()`. Default port 5173 (configurable via `FRONTEND_PORT`).

### Developer machine requirements

- **Python 3.11+** with **uv** (`pip install uv`)
- **Node.js 20+**
- A code editor

## 🚫 Never run services directly — always use scripts

When starting, stopping, or restarting backend or frontend, **you MUST use the scripts in `scripts/`**. Never invoke `uvicorn`, `vite`, `npm run dev`, or any equivalent command directly.

| ❌ Forbidden                                  | ✅ Correct                       |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `uv run uvicorn main:app --port 8080`         | `bash scripts/start-backend.sh`  |
| `npx vite --port 5173`                        | `bash scripts/start-frontend.sh` |
| `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080` | `bash scripts/start-all.sh`      |

**Why:** The scripts read `FRONTEND_PORT` and `BACKEND_PORT` from root `.env`. Running commands directly tempts you to hardcode a port, which will break if the user has changed their `.env` defaults.

**If you need to know the current ports** (e.g. to health-check or curl), read them from `.env`:

```bash
# Correct way to get ports in a one-off command
source .env && echo $BACKEND_PORT $FRONTEND_PORT
```

Never guess or hardcode `8080` or `5173` in any command or script you write.

---

## Common workflows

> **Windows users:** `.bat` scripts must run in **Command Prompt (cmd.exe)**, not PowerShell. In PowerShell, prefix with `cmd /c`, e.g. `cmd /c "scripts\start-all.bat"`.

### Starting the development environment

**Windows:**

```bat
scripts\start-all.bat
```

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
bash scripts/start-all.sh
```

### Restarting everything

**Windows:**

```bat
scripts\stop-all.bat
scripts\start-all.bat
```

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
bash scripts/stop-all.sh
bash scripts/start-all.sh
```

### Checking service status

**Windows:**

```bat
scripts\status.bat
```

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
bash scripts/status.sh
```

### Accessing the database

The SQLite database file is at `backend/db/pyworkflow.db`. Open it with any SQLite client (e.g., `sqlite3`, DB Browser for SQLite, or the SQLite VS Code extension).

### Production Docker mode

Production Docker configuration lives in `devops/`. Start with:

```bash
docker compose -f devops/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

The SQLite database file is persisted via volume mount at `backend/db/`.

## Domain language

This is an **empty starter project** — there is no domain language yet. As the project evolves, domain terms should be captured in `CONTEXT.md` and architectural decisions in `docs/adr/`. The `grill-with-docs` skill can help formalise this.

## System description

`SYSTEM.md` at the repo root is the living description of what this system actually does — features, domain model, key workflows, and out-of-scope items. It is maintained by the `update-system` skill. It does **not** exist until the first vibe-coding session produces real features. Run the `update-system` skill after any session that adds, changes, or removes features.

---

## Issue tracker

This repo uses the **local markdown** convention: issues live as files under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`. See `.agents/skills/setup-matt-pocock-skills/issue-tracker-local.md` for details.
